# E06a-Bullets
In this assignment, we are practicing depicting the carnage of enemy animals. 

* The animal we control, the narwhal, should be able to shoot little bullets at the penguins. 

* The penguins can survive a number of bullets before they will die(disappear, in this case). 
    - Each bullet is worth 10 damage
    - Each penguin has 100 HP
    - Therefore, 10 hits should destroy each penguin.
